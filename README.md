# GetReadyToWork


### WELCOME


## INTRODUCTION

GetReadyToWork is a python script originally created to free its user from the repetitive daily task of launching every app he needs on its machine before being able to work.
For exemple, a programmer would tipically start the day by launching his mailing app, his favorite browser, an IDE, a git GUI or whatever, before being able or willing to work.
----> What about doing it all with one click and go fetch some coffee instead ?

GetReadyToWork was born because of that, but is not meant to be a lot more... Creating a GUI would be overkill since a lot of apps already handle this.
I just made this to try python and see how compatibility can be handled.
So it's at the moment at an early stage but maybe it'll stay like that.


## COMPATIBLE PLATFORMS

Windows, Linux(WIP*), MacOS(WIP*)

Feel free to participate in this project with merge requests to make compatibility easier, every participation will be welcome.

## Launched applications

To launch the python script, install requirements.
